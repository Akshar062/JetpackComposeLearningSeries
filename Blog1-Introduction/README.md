Blog 1: Starting My Journey with Jetpack Compose
Overview
This blog post marks the beginning of my Jetpack Compose learning journey. Here, I introduce Jetpack Compose, explore how it differs from traditional XML-based layouts, and discuss why Google is moving towards this new UI toolkit.

Key Topics Covered
Introduction to Jetpack Compose: A brief look at what Jetpack Compose is and why it’s becoming essential for modern Android development.
Benefits of Jetpack Compose:
Declarative UI: Describing what the UI should look like, rather than how to build it.
Code-Only UI: Writing UI components in Kotlin, eliminating the need for XML.
State Management: Automatically updating UI components in response to data changes.
Faster Development and Previewing: Live previews in Android Studio for quicker iteration.
Differences from Traditional UI Development:
Imperative vs. Declarative paradigms.
Merging UI layout and logic in one Kotlin file.
Leveraging Kotlin language features for a streamlined UI.
Unified state management and reactive UI updates.
